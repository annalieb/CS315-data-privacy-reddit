NoNewNormal,"The virus is real (I've had it) but its severity is way overblown, and it's being used as a pretext for all kinds of abuse of power by governments, which are in turn corrupt and beholden to tech, pharma and finance companies, which are currently vacuuming up government contract money like pigs at the trough at feeding time. It's kind of like how the Iraq war was started using 9/11 as a flimsy pretext to put in motion things planned for years by neocons with oil and defense contractor connections, except this time the destruction (and opportunity, if you're Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos etc.) is worldwide. The vaccine is being used as another excuse for government tyranny, tech company surveillance of your most intimate personal data, and forced consumption of shoddy pharma products.

I honestly don't know what the conspiracy theory was  in Jan-Feb 2020. I wasn't consuming much news then, and what little I did consume was Democratic primary election news. I only started paying attention to covid19 once San Francisco went into lockdown, and while the virus did scare me for a bit, what the government was doing scared me far more.",1

Republican,"Yeah? Well, when they come out with one that isn't riskier than the virus itself I may consider it.

There's never been a working coronavirus vaccine before because they can't make them work like a vaccine should. These gene therapies aren't FDA approved for a reason. Ive watched someone die directly from the first moderna shot. Ive witnessed 2 belles Palsey cases personally. Ive also seen 2 blood clot cases. One that caused a stroke and one that caused a small heart attack. I know of about 30 people that got the virus, myself included. Only one was serious enough to be hospitalized and led to death. She had serious medical conditions beforehand. Oh, and herd immunity doesn't come from the vaccine only.

If people want to get the shot, thats on them. The people that dont want it should have the freedom to make that choice themselves. They definitely should have the opportunity to study the risks and make an educated choice without being shamed or forced into a hasty decision.

Ive been gathering data from everywhere possible to try and understand why people are having such a wide range of serious side effects. So far it looks like the deaths may be blood type related, but it's still too early to know for sure. Its becoming clear that the more severe the covid case the more antibodies people develop and the longer they last. Mild or almost non-existent cases produce very few antibodies that only last weeks. Severe cases that lasted the full 2 weeks and felt like the worst flu case ever seem to produce lots of antibodies that last atleast six months. I'll be keeping a close eye on when those antibodies disappear.

These are just some of the things that should be studied and made known to the public so that we can get a full understanding of what we're dealing with, but its not. We're getting pressured to take a shot that most people dont need, that doesn't provide the immunity it should. We're getting small freedoms dangled from a stick to coax us into making potentially life-altering decisions when none of us know the long term effects. Meanwhile, keeping your own immune system healthy has never entered the equation over the last year. If keeping people healthy was really the concern, things wouldve been handled completely different and our health gurus wouldn't have been lying to us and contradicting themselves the whole time. Ex. Fauci was interviewed the other day and was asked why he contradicted himself every other week last year, and why we should listen to him now? His response was ""I think the American people are *finally ready to hear the truth*"".

People should think about what that statement *really* implies.",0

changemyview,"&gt; I think it’s pretty reasonable to call Uber drivers non-employees... It’s not like they have any kind of exclusivity.

While this is true in practice, Uber has employed a bunch of deceptive tactics to target drivers that use both apps and manipulate them into exclusively using Uber. Their ""[Hell Program](https://www.engadget.com/2017-04-13-uber-hell-program-lyft-drivers.html)"" infringed on their driver's privacy and collected Lyft's driver data and upcoming ride requests via fraud, in an attempt to keep double-appers exclusively on Uber.

ledgerwallet,"&gt; That is surprising as I figure most ledger users will have at least a significant amount of understanding with cryptocurrency and the mnemonic recovery system.

You'd be surprised that it is not the case. In fact most Ledger users think that their cryptos are ""in their ledger device"". They treat they ledger with more care than they treat their seed, and often put their ledger in their safe, and lose their seed. That shows you their low understanding of crypto.

&gt; Now that we have addressed the 'vast majority' of cases, I would assume there are a minority of cases where the mnemonic recovery actually fails and the wallet data is lost?

There are a minority of cases that are still unexplained. Hypothesis range from rare firmware failure/bug, rare undetected transmission error on the USB wire, rare bug in some other part of the software chain (chrome libraries, libraries used by desktop apps or browser apps, etc), rare undetected hardware failure on the ledger (e.g. undetected failure on the flash memory) etc... Any hardware of software can have failure points, and even with Checksum and error detection, some errors can remain undetected. Those errors would be caught if the users had done a test-spend from their account or had accessed their account from other devices using the same seed, but in some cases, the users did none of that. I personally make sure to always do that!!

&gt; However, there have been multiple reported cases of BIP39 recovery phrases failing and users losing access to accounts. So it is either, users are the issue, or the hardware is the issue.

In the majority of those cases, this is because the mnemonic is incorrect, e.g. it has one wrong word that got undetected by the BIP39 checksum (the 8-bit checksum only detects 99.6% of word errors). Luckily those cases are very easy to recover using bruteforce methods to find the correct seed (can be done in minutes with the right software tools).

Cases that are still unexplained are extremely rare (I know a couple, some of my clients are in those situations).",0

Therefore, you're the exception, not the rule. Also, how is it sensationalist when I write long-form responses that cite statistical metrics? You're cherry picking one thing that I said out of long-form responses to a long-form thread. That's discourse, not sensationalism.

Also, self reporting may have been bad before, but it's still bad now. Unless you have a damn good reason reason why the data should be disregarded, it comes across as ""I don't like this data, so I won't engage with it."" That's pretty anti-intellectual.

virtualreality,"I think the diffrence is how this collected data is used. Facebook obviosly uses it commercially but also politically (to influence elections for example). The chinese controlled data collected on the other hand is used to determine the social credit score of the civilians, find and exterminate/jail political activists/not overly goverment supportive people or to directly censor their communication. The goverment also gets 0 resistance from the companies so you can't expect any privacy.

SkincareAddiction,"Isn't that how you end up with cults, though? Sticking blindly to a position and refusing to reconsider? 

One good thing she does is admit that she does change her mind with certain products or ingredients, either because more info comes in from data and studies, or because she gave it another chance. I, personally, tend to trust a bit more people who are capable to change their minds when confronted with new information.

Aside from that, she basically has a few hard lines that are very defensible from a dermatological science standpoint (sunscreen is good, fragrance not really, gimmicky ingredients / products meh, it's more the principle of misleading people that matters if they don't do actual harm, etc.) And, as for the rest, she tends to be rather flexible, and I think that's a good thing.

Now, her lifestyle part may not be the healthiest / most balanced content on YouTube, but her personal health issues are no one's concern but her own, I think. And her skincare part is solid. I don't need an expert to be charismatic, and I certainly don't need them to be a role model in every aspect of their life. Even in skincare, no one should be a role model.

germany,"You can't completely ignore cases, because you are risking introducing a bad variant to the world. We also still don't fully understand long term effects. Young people that beat it like a normal flu? They might have long term reduced lung capacity that we don't fully understand just yet.

All that said...I agree with your main point though. Once deaths are reduced and hospitals aren't overrun (due to vaccinating approximately age 50+ or age 60+), I'm not sure there's a great legal argument for restricting all aspects of life anymore. Other than variant fears, it would seemingly be a personal health choice rather than a public health situation at that point.

That's an area I break a bit with German politicians. If deaths remain low, I agree, I'm not sure we need to be screaming red alert and pulling our hair out over the crisis. It would still need to be managed, and people still need to understand you don't want to catch this thing...

We'll see. I bet deaths will start to catch up and the hospitals will remain strained for quite a while. I'm seeing more and more news across the world that ICU's are starting to contain far more young people than they used to. German ICU data is weird too. They say they will get overrun in the near future, but COVID patients actually ""only"" make up 10% of German ICU occupancy. So it kind of seems like ICU capacity is rather full even without COVID. Compare that to Italy where 30% of ICU usage is from COVID, Spain 20%, and France 80%! I think Germany just doesn't at all want to have to tap into ICU reserves, and they maybe don't have enough ICU nurses to keep up. I'm not sure.",0

cardano,"I don't think you'd (willingly) be giving your DID key away to anyone. I believe the idea is to use cryptography against your personal data, which (at least in ideal conditions) does not expose this key.

Through cryptography very much like the base chain uses for financial transactions, a DID key could do things like grant another party's key the ability to decrypt specific pieces of personal data. It does this (I would imagine anyway, this is just my notion so take w/ a salt grain or two) by signing certificates that grant such permissions.

This is very similar to the way we (SPOs), for example, use our keys to sign e.g. pool modification certificates to change our pool's parameters like margin, fees, pledge, etc. So this system seems to be an extension of that idea, but for personal data control and sharing.

There are also advertised features for revoking rights to specific permission certificates, which is not a new idea in public key cryptography. PGP has a mechanism for doing this for instance. CAs (certificate authorities that sign off on the integrity of many software programs) also have revokation mechanisms but they work a bit differently than a personal key. A personal key allows an individual to do revokations or authorizations themselves, whereas CAs follow a hierarchical centrally trusted signer model.

I would imagine (hope) that they have also considered the scenario of losing possession of your private key, there is some mentioning of generating a new one and revokation mechanisms would probably allow one to invalidate compromised credentials but I cannot guarantee that this exists in PRISM (even though it probably does) as I don't have first hand knowledge of its detailed workings, just a general understanding of cryptographic techniques and principles.

All in all it sounds promising. I hope this (educated guessing) explanation was helpful for you. :)",1
NoNewNormal,"Because C19 is much more infectious and can be carried asymptomatically much more so. In addition to lockdowns, social distancing and masks causing a huge reduction of the flu, people with the flu will likely stay home when they are sick as they are likely to have symptoms.

2FA isn't trivial but there are some fairly standard solutions available. Offering (not forcing) 2FA for common users and enforcing 2FA for admin users goes a long way to securing a site from similar things in the future.

PC engine only needs 8 Data pins to ROM ( but sadly 21 instead of 20 for address ) : http://wiki.pcengine.info/pmwiki.php?n=HuCard.HuCardPinout

Why PC Engine is much like NES: https://nicole.express/2020/personal-computer-engine.html

NES in turn seems to be inspired by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments_TMS9918#Sprites from 1979
8x8 sprites
more sprites on screen (32) than on scanline (4)

C64 (1982) has 3 color + transparency sprites which NES (1983) copied

I could never make much use of the palette on VGA, so for me it is weird that the PCE engine even has one complete chip just for the palette and a second one for the DAC. And even then they couldn't be bothered to do 4096 colors for some fancy copper sky. Though I think NES is similar and we all appreciate the RGB (via expansion port) and HDMI mods made possible by this.

&gt;The NESRGB board effectively bypasses parts of the PPU - Palette RAM (Color Generator), Decoder, and DAC

Would've been cool if the expansion post would physically be SCART and electrically support just RGB with other pins redefined to support expansions.

gunpolitics,"&gt; Your not a strong guns advocate... Stop selling yourself in what your not.  At most your a minor gun rights advocate.

Check my Username on Reddit, I have an endless supply of Gun Advocacy Posts. 

https://www.reddit.com/user/the_blue_wizard

But also check out r/idiotswithguns and you will see what I mean. 

Fine if people want to be an idiots in their bedroom making a fool out of themselves waving a gun around fine. But I'm not sure I want those idiots on the streets with guns. Though certainly they can be on the streets with guns with or without my approval, and with or without govt approval. But I would feel more comfortable if I knew everyone was working from the same basic knowledge set. 

But I could potentially say the same thing about cars. Anyone who has ever tried to drive on public roads, knows there are FAR TOO MANY Idiots with Drives License. And that is despite requiring training and proving a minimum of driving ability. I'd like to take a few of them off the road too. 

But I get to have my opinion. CCW should not be a condition of buying a pistol or shooting one in approved places *(private land, public hunting land, private ranges, public ranges, etc...)* 

However CCW is not carrying or shooting a Pistol at a range or on private land, it is carrying a pistol around in public. Dealing with potentially high stress tactical situations. 

Though the context is different, I can make it apply here. To contrast Cars and Guns to people who say you have to do this to drive, but you only have to do this lesser thing to have a gun, I ask people to think about the last time they drove their car, and *How many Cars did you see?* Even in a small town the answer is probably hundreds. Now on that same drive, ask yourself how many Guns you saw? I'm guessing virtually none. Car/Motor Vehicles are used on public roads with hundreds of other drivers, so we need more training and stricter rules. Gun, on the other hand, *over simplifying,* are used in private. They don't need that same level of regulation. And they are a Right. 

However CCW is different, you are now using/carrying that gun in public, and that comes with a higher level of responsibility. And that higher degree of responsibility comes with a higher degree of training. I don't care how many times you watched *""John Wick""* that doesn't qualify you to carry a gun in public. In fact, I would say just the opposite, until you are formally trained, it disqualifies you to carry a gun in public. 

So, I can make a distinction between having and shooting a Gun, and public carrying of a Gun/Pistol - conceal or open carry. Indeed Conceal and Open Carry come with a higher level of responsibility and a higher level of need for training. 

I understand opinions, such as your that are opposite of mine, and like I said, I'm not in Texas, so Texas can do anything it wants. And I know that there are a few other States that are Constitutional Carry. 

And I further understand that Constitutional Carry is Gun Owners blow-back for the ever encroaching infringement of our Rights. And given how far Gun Control has been taken it so far, perhaps it is right to push it strongly in the opposite direction. As an example, if they are going to take it too far to the Left, then perhaps we need to take it too far to the Right just to restore balance. 

I personally think there can be Fact Based Common Sense Gun Laws, but so far *Common Sense and Facts have be wholly lacking in Gun Control.* 

For example the call to ban or severely restrict *Tactical/Sport Rifles* is completely irrational. Averaged over the last 5 years of available data from the FBI, there were 314.6 Rifle Homicides per year. 

But contrast -

- You are 300 TIMES MORE LIKELY to die an ALCOHOL related death than you are to be murdered by a Rifle. (CDC, NIH)
- You are 65 TIMES MORE LIKELY to die of a Gun Related Suicide than to be murdered by a Rifle (FBI, CDC)
- You are 22 TIMES MORE LIKELY to die simply because your DOCTOR has crappy handwriting. (TIME Mag, various)
- You are 10 TIMES MORE LIKELY to DROWN than to be murdered by a Rifle. (CDC, various)
- You are 5 TIMES MORE LIKELY to be murdered with a KNIFE than you are to be murdered by a Rifle. (FBI)
- You are 3.5 TIMES MORE LIKELY to kill yourself than you are to be murdered by a Pistol (FBI, CDC)
- You are 2.7 TIMES MORE LIKELY to be Beaten to Death than to be murdered by a Rifle (FBI)
- You are more likely to DIE USING YOUR CELL PHONE, than you are to be murdered by a Rifle. (NHTSA - distracted driving)
- You are more likely to be STRUCK BY LIGHTNING than to be murdered by a Rifle. In California with the highest number of Rifle Deaths, the odd are still 1 in 1.1 Million compared to 1 in 700,000 to be Struck By Lightning.  (National Geographic, FBI 2019) 
- Medical Malpractices takes the lives of 250,000 people per year. 685 people per Day (John Hopkins, various)
- Rifles about 315/yr (FBI, 5yr avg)
- Tactical/Sport Rifles about 150/yr (various estimates)

So, clearly the hysteria over Rifles and Tactical/Sport Rifles is absolute horse sh!t. But it is sensationalistic, and the Guns look scary, so it is easy to gin up manufactured consent to control them, even though the data does not bear out a need. 

I don't have a problem with ownership of Pistols, or shooting Pistols, but I see Conceal Carry is a different beast with more responsibility, and therefore a greater and surer need for basic training.

And you are free to have the opposite opinion, but I think I have made my position clear, and I leave it to other to weight the information and come to their own informed conclusions, what ever those conclusions might be.",0
explainlikeimfive,"&gt;What. You just used 800 characters to construct a meaningless distinction. Complexity and speed, in the context you are using, are causally linked to each other, rendering the order irrelevant. What a waste of words...

What? Speed and complexity are not the same thing and they aren't even casually linked, more often than not they go in opposite directions in terms of sacrificing speed for complexity or complexity for speed. 

&gt;You've used over a thousand characters and all you have said is ""teeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeechnicallllllllllllllllllly, your usage of words is not perfectly accurate"". Which, yea, well, I know. Good job.

But that's the point... You're comparing it to the brain and to intelligence and making grandstanding predictions on how our brain works and whatnot and NONE of that is a given. We don't yet know how our brain works and whether it is a perfectly deterministic system. Some assume that because we also assume that the universe is a deterministic system and we further assume that we are just part of that nature. But that's going deep into philosphy, religion and whatnot. When in reality, for those computer algorithms we'd actually know how they work and we can track all their steps, it's a lot, which makes it difficult but unlike for our brain, it's feasible and due to the lack of complexity not as difficult. 

Also may I remind you that YOU startet the ""teeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeechnicallllllllllllllllllly, machine learning is about 'Maaaachiiiiiines' and 'leeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaarning' and not just computers going through algorithms""? So explaining what a machine actually is and what learning means is kind of necessary if there is such a confusion on terminology.

&gt;Hence, the added ""agent"". But sure. It gets increasingly clear that your biggest issue is improper use of language and has virtually nothing to do with AI of any kind. And I'm not sure that I'm really in the mood for a semantics discussion...

And what is that other than a buzzword? I mean literally an agent is something or someone that is action in an environment. That's all, so it's an application of such a system. 

&gt;Yea... for identifying digits. Good shit. It won't be playing Starcraft though. So... good ... point... I guess?

And playing starcraft is a hard task? I mean there's literally an API for researchers and hobbyists to let their networks play starcraft:
https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/starcraft2/20944009/the-starcraft-ii-api-has-arrived

And that might even be more simple than identifying digits depending on where you get the information. Idk for stuff like chess go and starcraft you have a set of rules and objectives that clearly determine what is working and not working (trial and error) so if you supply it with internal state mechanism and thus give it a more abstract interfact that might even be easier than giving the network a huge pile of pixel colors and hope that it will identify objects. 

Though if you don't give it a nice interface, it has to do the object identification of the pixels in addition to learning to play the game.

Also while apparently google used captchas to develop their OCR (optical character recognition) and while idk all your digital assistance probably record your voice to better their speech recognition and speech generation, I'm talking more about the general pile of data in terms of individual user interaction that they generate daily and that few other entities have access to.

&gt;Why is that the people who whine the most about AI also tend to be the people who get extremely triggered if you so much as suggest that the human brain might not be magic after all? I find that odd. Actually, I don't find it odd at all, but you probably should...

That's completely irrelevant personal opinion.

&gt;Unless we fundamentally change the architecture of how the brain works, it'll still be a deterministic machine and so it isn't doing anything more fancy than what you could do with pen and paper, just a whole lot faster.

Well our brain actually has a different kind of architecture in that all these neurons are somewhat interconnected and feeding into each other in weird way. And if you would want to fully connect each neuron with every other neuron you'd run into technical problems because that growths with the faculty function so n! = n*(n-1)! meaning with 69 nodes you'd already approach a googol (10¹⁰⁰ and yes that is where googles name comes from) which is more connections than there are atoms in the universe and 69 nodes is nothing. So it's impossible to keep such a big system in the memory of even the biggest supercomputer and you'd rather need a botnet of simpler machines which again means you're losing a lot of the initial overview over what is happening and introduce a lot of uncertainties like communication speed, uncertainties of the state of a given machine and so on. And wehther that would end up being a thing with a consciousness similar to ourselfs or remain a deterministic machine, is still up for debate. I mean not that it would be a deterministic machine as we literally built them as such, but the consciousness part and whatnot.",0
chimebank,"To refresh folks' minds on the matter, let's reiterate the following:

Chime **is not** a bank themselves.  Banking ***services*** are provided by The Bancorp Bank (unaffiliated with US Bank) and Stride Bank.  Both financial institutions are insured through FDIC.  

No, Chime does not rely on ChexSystems to determine an applicant's ability to obtain an account.  Often touted as a second-chance bank account, Chime and others like it provide a more robust financial solution compared to prepaid debit cards like American Express Serve.

Often what I've read on these forums (long-time lurker, first-time poster), people who have had negative experiences with Chime fall into one of two categories.  First, it's someone who has co-mingled funds from a business into a Chime account.  This could be the result of a PPP Loan that was taken out.  By default, these ""fintechs"" are going to exercise extreme caution when it comes to these loans.  Sadly, fraud has been committed by multiple individuals and these companies have little alternative when it comes to automatic account closures.  

Before anyone gets their undergarments in a bunch, let me make this point perfectly clear - companies spend significant amounts of money in automation.  When you are dealing with billions of dollars, you want to eliminate the possibility of human error.  Oh, but to err is human, right?  Wrong.  We are a ""woke"" society and now everything from one's preferred pronouns can be taken out of context if referenced incorrectly.  So, remove the human factor and focus on actual metrics.  Those metrics, right or wrong, dictate how these organizations operate.  As I said, they spend significant amounts of money.  And you know what?  They are going to trust that data.  

The other category is one-sided accounts from people who, honestly, know what they did or did not do in order to have their account closed.  There are two sides to every story, and all too often we only get to hear the customer side because that is what this subreddit is all about.  What about the other, corporate side?  Well, you won't get that level of detail because that is personal information private to the account holder and Chime.  So do not blindly trust someone's account of poor treatment by Chime, Varo, N26, or any other ""online bank"".  Ask probing questions, and get the conversation to a meaningful and productive spot.  It's not hard to have civil, public discourse over the internet.  

I've had Chime for 3 years.  In that time I've suspended my account a handful of times because I just felt better with a brick and mortar bank.  Now that I've decided to go full-on with either N26 or Chime, I realize that my use case is quite different than the average banker.  Instead of waiting for a company to say ""your usage is abnormal"", I flat out tell them what I'm going to do with their service.  If it's against the TOS, I'll gladly close my account for you.  I was given an official statement by Chime, which I've archived through time-stamped screenshots from within the app, is that how I plan on using the account is not currently outside of the scope of their TOS.  Does that mean I'm safe forever?  No.  It does mean that at some point the TOS will be updated, and I will have to pay attention for changes which affect my unique use case.",0
CoronavirusUK,"It's not arbitrary though, there is an exact scientific reason for that date which is the opposite of arbitrary.

If we open up too soon and we don't allow enough time between the steps, we will have to go backwards and possibly close things that do not need to be closed at least this provides more certainty.

It's easy to sit on a sofa and complain just because you want reality to be different, but it still needs to be driven  by data. Yes if your business is under threat you would be screaming for things to open sooner and with that end goal you will use any excuse, i.e case numbers, vaccines etc, but an exact deliberate plan has been set out and there are strong reasons for having that, just because people have personal situations or personal goals that differ or that would benefit from a different course of action, does not suddenly make it the right action.",0

Just because you personally don’t see a problem doesn’t mean the problem doesn’t exist. Here’s an excellent article from the [WHO](https://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/334269/14780_World-Health-Organisation_Context-of-Health_TEXT-AW-WEB.pdf) talking about culture in healthcare.

Someone who’s Italian will have cultural difference vs someone who is Irish. We are learning more and more in healthcare you can’t treat two people the same way. Even two people of the same ethnicity can have widely different needs. 330 million people with widely different cultures, backgrounds, etc all living together can make healthcare more complicated. 

If I tried to mention everything that creates issues with America’s healthcare system vs other countries we would be here all day, tomorrow and the next day. It’s a very complex problem.

technology,"&gt; paywall....Disable the Js and you won't get the paywall!

A user in a low level hacking forum on Saturday published the phone numbers and personal data of hundreds of millions of Facebook users for free online.

The exposed data includes personal information of over 533 million Facebook users from 106 countries, including over 32 million records on users in the US, 11 million on users in the UK, and 6 million on users in India. It includes their phone numbers, Facebook IDs, full names, locations, birthdates, bios, and — in some cases — email addresses.

Insider reviewed a sample of the leaked data and verified several records by matching known Facebook users' phone numbers with the IDs listed in the data set. We also verified records by testing email addresses from the data set in Facebook's password reset feature, which can be used to partially reveal a user's phone number.

A Facebook spokesperson told Insider that the data was scraped due to a vulnerability that the company patched in 2019.

""A database of that size containing the private information such as phone numbers of a lot of Facebook's users would certainly lead to bad actors taking advantage of the data to perform social engineering attacks [or] hacking attempts,"" Gal told Insider.

Gal first discovered the leaked data in January when a user in the same hacking forum advertised an automated bot that could provide phone numbers for hundreds of millions of Facebook users in exchange for a price. Motherboard reported on that bot's existence at the time and verified that the data was legitimate.

Now, the entire dataset has been posted on the hacking forum for free, making it widely available to anyone with rudimentary data skills.

    —Alon Gal (Under the Breach) (@UnderTheBreach) April 3, 2021

Insider attempted to reach the leaker through messaging app Telegram but did not get a response.

This is not the first time that a huge number of Facebook users' phone numbers have been found exposed online. The vulnerability that was uncovered in 2019 allowed millions of people's phone numbers to be scraped from Facebook's servers in violation of its terms of service. Facebook said that vulnerability was patched in August 2019. 

Facebook previously vowed to crack down on mass data-scraping after Cambridge Analytica scraped the data of 80 million users in violation of Facebook's terms of service to target voters with political ads in the 2016 election.

Gal said that, from a security standpoint, there's not much Facebook can do to help users affected by the breach since their data is already out in the open — but he added that Facebook could notify users so they could remain vigilant for possible
phishing
schemes or fraud using their personal data.

""Individuals signing up to a reputable company like Facebook are trusting them with their data and Facebook [is] supposed to treat the data with utmost respect,"" Gal said. ""Users having their personal information leaked is a huge breach of trust and should be handled accordingly.""",1

cookingforbeginners,"You make some good points and ask some good questions. I can't speak to the safety of meat in any other country because I am primarily focused on looking at data in my country of residence but it does seem likely that there are countries with less rigorous slaughtering and meat handling regulations. 

1. To address your first point, you're right to say that using non-running water would reasonably cause less splashing but there's also little to no evidence to say that those other methods are going to actually help significantly reduce the number of bacteria on the surface of your meat.
2. I wouldn't call the practice toxic really, it's just a riskier practice than not washing the meat. There are definitely lots of ways that could potentially spread meat juice around your kitchen! I won't disagree with you there at all but at this point we're talking about a diluted sample of bacteria. There's definitely still bacteria on the cutting board, and bacteria that are going to splash out of the sink with some water while washing your cutting board but this is going to be more dilute and again less risky than the water droplets directly contacting the raw chicken which has a higher number of bacteria. 
3. I can't really speak on this point and this thread has definitely gotten me interested to see if there is research out there on the prevalence of meat washing across different cultures! It could be a good learning experience.
4. There is no meat whatsoever that is guaranteed to be perfectly hygienic especially when raw. Even meat that has been cooked to the proper temperature will likely have bacteria there just not the ones that make us sick (or enough of the ones that make us sick). I haven't really experienced either of those problems personally... there is a slimy layer that can occur on chicken but I just cook the chicken and anecdotally I've never had any issues. However, maybe using something like a paper towel to remove bone chips or something while also patting the chicken dry (which is nice for extra good browning) could be a less risky method of taking care of those issues.
5. That absolutely is a good idea! It's a great idea to clean and sanitize your kitchen surfaces after you've been cooking and everyone should in my opinion, do exactly that. If you are going to wash your meat, I would say that becomes an even more important risk-reduction step. Also, you mention that FDA's advice is not law. That's true and that's not the goal of public health agencies. People do like to say it like it is law and based on the data that we have, it is the best practice to not wash meat. But public health agencies are not here to tell you what to do. They are here to give you all the information that you need to make informed decisions on what you want to do based on who you are as a person and your tolerance for risks. 
6. So this is a really fascinating point and I love that you thought of this! This is very good thinking and this is something that should be studied more! As I mentioned earlier, I would assume that the dilution that comes with each step in the cleaning process would pose less and less of a risk but I don't know that for sure. However, there's a risk with everything! You could apply the same logic to washing your hands. When you first start washing your hands, especially in public restrooms, there's often water that gets splashed around that has touched your dirty hands. Does that pose a risk? Yes. How significant is that risk? Well, it depends and it's complicated! I would recommend to you a podcast called ""Risky or Not?"" which is a short podcast usually less than 10 or 15 minutes which briefly delves into the risk posed by everyday situations!

Anyway, I think you have a great way of thinking and it's important that everyone understands that everything has a degree of risk and that bacteria are literally everywhere but we can take whatever steps we deem necessary (based on things like our risk tolerance) and make our own informed decisions.",0

Libertarian,"No, my point has been that he got shit done, shit that he promised he would. You can call me all you want, but don't call me a liar. I have yet to say anything about ""poor little Trump"". 

I'll have to check you on those numbers, but even then, why the hell would I trust any ""media"" source to tell me how many lies he told? I find it so very unlikely. They know people aren't going to check them on that, they can throw whatever number they want out 95% of people will take it at face value. If anyone goes and finds a discrepancy, they'll just be labeled a liar by the 95% who didn't themselves. That is the reality of our current society. So no, I am not going to go count every lie by every president. I have far better things to do with my time. I doubt you have counted it all yourself, so you are stating a fact I doubt you actually can confirm or deny is true.

So maybe I should have watched my wording. While I do not know if he absolutely did not tell more lies than his predecessors, I find it highly unlikely. I also would be interested to know how many lies were significant lies versus insignificant lies. Many of Trumps lies, that I know of, were over stupid shit. With time I am sure the corruption of the administration will come out, as with any other administration, and I will adjust that view accordingly. 

I did address Trump lying about crowd sizes, but if I didn't specifically state that, yes my talking about all presidents and most government ""leaders"" are habitual and compulsive liars. Equally, I do not know if it is even true, I am taking your word that it is. So no, I will not ""admit"" he was the first president to lie in their first official pronouncement. Quite honestly, that seems incredibly unlikely. What seems far more likely is lazy research looking back, and the fact that the lie Trump told is so obvious. Have you yourself gone back to every single single pronouncement to confirm that what you yourself, once again claiming as absolute fact, is even true? 

I am appreciating that he wasn't the devil that people have made him out to be, not defending him. 90% if people's hate for him is usually based in misinformation or because he said mean things on Twitter. I do not hate liberals, nor do I hate republicans. What I hate are arguments being made with biased or unconfirmed data. It is the root of ignorance. Ignorance is the main driver of the extreme hypocrisy we see every day in today's society. We are all guilty of it at times, including myself, but some more than others.

LoriVallow,"Not an MG sympathizer.  Nor do I have enough concrete evidence at this point to feel as strongly as I do about LV and CD... regarding their roles and guilt.

Had a couple.more thoughts... albeit perhaps not the most riveting.

I do appreciate Annie and her approach to attempting to pull together more info and data.  They are long convos but very insightful for a variety of reasons IMO.

I agree MG is for sure covering her tush.  

The fact that MG is participating is probably a smattering of multiple drivers:

I am sure she does feel guilty and ashamed - after being exposed for her activities with these people.  To what degree,  I have no clue.

I am sure she probably also feels some annoyance for the fact that tbey all ended up in this current state and the house of cards crashed.  I know I'd be pissed if Dateline and other media outlets started hounding me over unsavoury things from my life.

I also think she struggles with some degree of personal conflict with how she actually feels/felt about Chad and Lori.

I think it's possible MG is annoyed to have been part of the click and then may have started getting iced out (to some degree)... so LV and CD could tighten their grib of power and assets.  If not over the group's power...as a best friend.  Perhaps getting annoyed if MG had been Lori's number 1 and got replaced by Chad.  (Hell, I think any ""reasonable human"" would be pissed to have someone take Chad and his garbage priorities over our own.)

It is also entirely possible that MG is 100% in and turned state's evidence to hide in plain sight.  

I am willing to bet the not so talked about peope of their group who remain in the shadows are not all that happy with MG... wouldn't shock me if she has a target hanging over her head.

If this is the case, perhaps she is less sorry than some may want to believe and only trying to stay alive/out of harms way.

I tend to think people did have some plan A and plan B stuff going on... that probably didn't involve MG skipping around giving interviews left and right.

Perhaps a conflict of what she was supposed to do and what someone else, say DW, thinks they should started to pull her into different directions. - Creating the inconsistencies in her stories, etc...

Chad was an idiot... were he and Lori the ""Patsies"" for a larger and more sinister group of individuals?",0
LivestreamFail,"I'm not trained or certified in GDPR compliance, but still work (somewhat) closely with the subject (software engineer in education). I'd love to be corrected if I'm wrong :)

GDPR doesn't care about the reason for processing personal data. I did a quick 30 seconds of googling, as you suggested above, and found that:

&gt;The GDPR can apply in virtually any context, except one.  
&gt;  
&gt;Article 2 of the GDPR states that the GDPR doesn't apply to a ""purely personal or household activity.""

So the argument that Quin is only storing the chat logs for toxicity testing isn't relevant; he's storing personal data, period. And I should clarify ""storing"", because it could well be that's he's not storing the chat logs, but rather just passing it through his black box. But GDPR covers ""processing of personal data"", not just storage, so that doesn't matter.

I don't watch Quin, but let's pretend for a second that I do. When I type in his chat, I'm comfortable with **Twitch** storing my data, because by creating an account on their platform, I've agreed to their privacy notice which outlines how they'll store and use my data, and what I can do to request it (or delete it).

As a viewer, no where have I agreed to a ""Quin privacy notice"" that describes how they intend to use my data, or what I can do to request deletion. Maybe, by agreeing to Twitch's privacy notice, I'm also agreeing to let streamers process my data that's related to them (chat on their streams), but I don't know if that's the case. I'm not going to sit and read through the whole of Twitch's privacy notice.

I'm not too fussed about the whole situation (although I've just wrote a bunch of paragraphs lol); as you mentioned, he's just using it for some dumb filter thing on Twitch chat. But GDPR is here for a reason, and if you start letting people process personal data with disregard for GDPR because it's ""just some dumb thing"", then it could be the start of a slippery slope. What constitutes something dumb enough that GDPR should be quietly ignored? That definition is extremely subjective.",1
BlockedAndReported,"&gt; The part of this I disagree with is that 90% of the writing on cancel culture is RW BS. I don't read RW BS.

Well, you see the obvious contradiction there, right?   You're basically saying you avoid all evidence and therefore by the evidence you personally see the conclusion is false.  Given the rest of your response, I don't think that's exactly what you meant.  I think you're implying that while 90% may or may not be RW BS, you personally don't really deal with that and the remaining 10% is still a lot and well worth contending with and *that's* the stuff you're talking about.   So 90% of *your* data feed and *your* conversation isn't RW BS.  Let me know if I'm reading you wrong.  

And all that may be true, but there's still a stream you swim in.  Dr Seuss and Mr Potato Head may be unimportant to you, but they gained massively more coverage in the mainstream and right-leaning press than did the Harper's Letter or anything J&amp;K have ever written or talked about.   My only point here is that I often hear the complaint that ""I made this reasonable argument and my acquaintances didn't take it seriously"" by people who are completely ignorant of the fact that they accidentally copied the *exact* phrasing that Tucker Carlson has been screaming about for a week.   

All in all, we're not really disagreeing too much I think.   As I said, this definitely isn't 100% a talking point of the right, but any public conversation *does* need to take into account that this *is* a major talking point of the right.   But it's nuanced.  It's wrong to take the right's involvement as an excuse to dismiss all aspects of the issue.  But it's also wrong I think to treat every argument that this may be exaggerated as just dismissing the issue entirely.   There's a lot of room between those two extremes.

brasilnoticias," RIO - O prazo para preencher e enviar a declaração do [Imposto de Renda 2021](https://oglobo.globo.com/economia/imposto-de-renda/), ano-base 2020, vai [até o dia 31 de maio](https://oglobo.globo.com/economia/ir-2021-mais-de-12-milhoes-de-pessoas-ainda-nao-enviaram-declaracao-receita-prazo-acaba-dia-31-24894464). Até sexta-feira, mais de 12 milhões de pessoas ainda não tinham feito isso. 

Quem sai da prestação de contas com imposto a pagar e não está com o bolso preparado para se livrar da dívida de uma vez tem uma opção de parcelamento. 

**Tutorial: **[Veja passo a passo como preencher a declaração](https://oglobo.globo.com/economia/ir-2021-tres-semanas-do-fim-do-prazo-143-milhoes-ainda-nao-entregaram-declaracao-confira-passo-passo-24894464)

O programa permite ao contribuinte amenizar o impacto no orçamento familiar parcelando o valor em até oito prestações. Mas é preciso ficar atento sobre a incidência de juros. 

Tire suas dúvidas:

Quais as condições para parcelar o IR 2021?
-------------------------------------------

A primeira coisa que o contribuinte deve saber é se o valor do seu imposto a pagar se encaixa nas condições de parcelamento. 

É possível parcelar o imposto cujo valor é superior a R$ 100. O imposto pode ser parcelado em até oito prestações, sendo cada uma de pelo menos R$ 50.

 **Dicas: **[Veja como aumentar a restituição ou diminuir imposto a pagar](https://oglobo.globo.com/economia/ir-2021-confira-dicas-para-aumentar-restituicao-ou-diminuir-imposto-pagar-24949263)

Como é feito o pagamento das prestações?
----------------------------------------

O parcelamento é automático e pode ser debitado diretamente da conta do contribuinte por meio de instituições financeiras conveniadas à Receita.

O valor muda?
-------------

Quem optar pelo parcelamento vai pagar um pouco a mais. A partir da segunda parcela há incidência de juro de 1% sobre o valor de cada prestação, acrescida da variação da taxa Selic a partir do dia 1º de junho até a data de vencimento da parcela.

Vale lembrar que atualmente a Selic está em 3,5% ao ano. Por isso, quem escolher pagar parcelado terá que arcar com um valor diferente a cada mês, corrigido por essa que é a taxa básica de juros do país.

He also shouldn't have been given his job because his clearance was meant to have been revoked but that was a failure in the clearance system and of the processes of the contractor he worked for. There was also personal information released that he should have censored (although he blames the Guardian for this). 

Snowdon is also an extreme exaggerator and anything he says about his life needs to be taken with a lot of critical analysis. Most of his claims since he's lived in Russia are really easily debunked.

A nursing home in Prescott, Arizona, is under scrutiny after a months-long investigation by state health officials revealed that managers required staffers to work while visibly sick with COVID-19.

""Overall, DCH is reporting more COVID-19 deaths. The most recent reports to DCH report showed 3,489 among nursing home residents, about 21% of all Georgia’s confirmed COVID-19 deaths so far, DPH said. That total doesn’t include hundreds more than took place in assisted living communities and large personal care homes.""

However, IMO, even whales have their limit. They can easily get all the items available in every BP (aegis and roshan included). So what motivate them to spend more after all of that but their desire/wants/needs to support the game they love? I believe this motivation also applies to average players as well. 

I personally have purchased every BP since TI3 or TI4 (I can't check right now) and has slowly transitioned from grinding to just paying for levels (and found my BP levels higher each year) as, due to my career development, I got paid more. This applies to most players (because, tbh, quitting Dota is hard as f\*\*k) and since their financial gets better and better, so is their tolerance. So as long as their data shows that they haven't crossed the line, it's highly unlikely that Valve would change.",1

Also, truck owners aren't all who you think they are. Here, [have a read](https://www.thedrive.com/news/26907/you-dont-need-a-full-size-pickup-truck-you-need-a-cowboy-costume).

&gt;So what do people actually like about trucks? According to Edwards, the answer is counterintuitive. Truck drivers use their trucks very much  like other car owners: for commuting to and from work, presumably alone.  The thing that most distinguishes truck owners from those of other  vehicles is their sheer love of driving. “The highest indexed use among  truck owners is pleasure driving,” says Edwards. Truck drivers use their  vehicles this way fully twice as often as the industry average.  
&gt;  
&gt;According to Edwards’ data, 75 percent of truck owners use their truck  for towing one time a year or less (meaning, never). Nearly 70 percent  of truck owners go off-road one time a year or less. And a full 35  percent of truck owners use their truck for hauling—putting something in  the bed, its ostensible *raison d’être*—once a year or less.   
&gt;  
&gt;When asked for attributes that are important to them, Edwards says, truck owners oversample in ones like: the ability to outperform others,  to look good while driving, to present a tough image, to have their car  act as extension of their personality, and to stand out in a crowd.

That's why acceleration will matter. It's a masculine power display.",0
privacytoolsIO,"I have been using andOTP for a long time now. My database is password protected and I login with my password manager because unlocking with fingerprint didn't work at the time.

By now I rely heavily on TOTP and I revisited the topic and am very glad to see unlocking with fingerprint now works with andOTP.

Still I am going to switch to Aegis now for the following reasons:

1. Backups to Nextcloud do not work with andOTP (although this seems to be solved with the next release ([andOTP/issues/729](https://github.com/andOTP/andOTP/issues/729)))
2. I can see my account details more clearly with Aegis
3. Aegis does not need internet access.  
andOTP is fetching the favicons of the websites which does look nice and makes finding the right TOTP easier but Aegis is working to integrate icons into the app without internet access which might be more desirable for privacy (see [Aegis/issues/509](https://github.com/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/509))",1

gunpolitics,"&gt; The problem is that such a small sample size was undoubtedly obtained by just one method.


If that's your issue than prove that it isn't just an assumption and we can go from there. I'd do it but it's not my assumption. 

Full disclosure: My educational focus was analytical chem and my masters is that statistical analysis. Although, I don't deal with people and polling I like to think I have a pretty good idea how things should work mathematically or can figure out what they were doing and why. 

&gt;If you look at Pew Research's methods (I realize they aren't the ones performing this poll) they use phone calls exclusively, with at least 30% of those calls needing to come from a landline.

&gt;How many people 30 and younger have a landline phone for personal use? None.

https://www.pewresearch.org/methods/u-s-survey-research/our-survey-methodology-in-detail/

Pew explains their rationale there. Here is the text that explains landline polling

&gt;We sample landline and cellphone numbers to yield a combined sample with approximately 25% of the interviews conducted by landline and 75% by cellphone. This ratio is based on an analysis that attempts to balance cost and fieldwork considerations as well as to improve the overall demographic composition of the sample (in terms of age, race/ethnicity and education). This ratio also ensures an adequate number of cell-only respondents in each survey.

&gt;The design of the landline sample ensures representation of both listed and unlisted numbers (including those not yet listed) by using random digit dialing. This method uses random generation of the last two digits of telephone numbers selected on the basis of the area code, telephone exchange and bank number. A bank is defined as 100 contiguous telephone numbers, for example 800-555-1200 to 800-555-1299. The telephone exchanges are selected to be proportionally stratified by county and by telephone exchange within the county. That is, the number of telephone numbers randomly sampled from within a given county is proportional to that county’s share of telephone numbers in the U.S. Only banks of telephone numbers containing one or more listed residential numbers are selected.

Seems like they use landlines to get more older people that are more likely to pick up a home phone.



&gt;Until the technology gap between generations disappears, polling is worthless.

Like I said I don't deal with polling people but I am a data scientist and I have seen no one raise serious questions about Pews methods that Pew didn't address. They are really transparent with questions and datasets.

To accomplish simple tasks (ex. add a confirmation pop up when saving a new record, manipulating multiple records that are dependent, etc.) requires you to basically ignore ReactAdmin entirely and interface directly with ReactFinalForm and MaterialUI, but then because ReactAdmin is doing some additional magic/interference it only works as expected 80% of the time. Good luck in the other 20%.

In many cases we found ourselves making custom routes and adapting the data model to make ReactAdmin happy, which is the opposite of ReactAdmin’s value proposition.

AIDungeon,"""Cause they deserve it""🤣.
Well aside that it is mainly for 4-5 reasons:
1)They decided to introduce a Child por.... filter that was broken ad that was censoring basically everything(Watermelons,horses, ecc.).

2)They basiclly confermed that they can read every stories that we create, even the umpublished one if the C.p. filter was triggered, and that privacy was never an option we could have.

3)They hidded some data leaks of the user stories and informatins that happened and faked that this never happened.

4)They started a semi-hate campaign against the users, blocking the many comumunities on discord and other social network, deleting proposal and petition to change the filter, and started to being uncollaborative to the many users, mainly by one of the 2 cofunders.
Also they banned some people that made a script that prevented people to insert some of the blacklisted words, that because the Developer wanted people to trigger the broken filter even if it was by accident.

5)Apparently they decided to expand, little by little this filter, till the Ai will become what they, and Open Ai Ceo, want. Obviously, the now lobotomized AI can't carry on, as it can't even allow some word combination in the same story, and all users are angry about this and want the all the broken-filters removed to have the old Ai capable to make interessing stories as before.
but because the Developers won't hear us we decided to start destroy their reputation on the many review sites and remove our economic contribution to them, it is in our right to protest and we will do it till the end.

Also apparently they even proihibited the users to express any opinion on Latitude or his workers, so that when they read our stories they wont have to fell bad.

Now mark my words, i don't support any side in this terrible story, i only can't stand any form of censoring or limitation of freedom of speech, even more if it is only writing some text that no one cares about and can't even be seen by any other aside the user. I have already seen to many good peoples that where silenced by more powerfull figures in these years, and i can't stand that is happening even in something pointless as a game.",1

UpliftingNews,"1) They are literally making personalized cancer vaccines now, it’s probably one of the most exciting developments in cancer therapy ever made. These have already advanced past early stage clinical trials (human testing) for melanoma. 
2) In a totally anticompetitive market, yes there would be financial incentive for monopolistic or oligopolistic firms to not make a cure for cancer, but any random university scientist with strong enough preclinical data (or clinical if they’re lucky enough to have physician collaborators) can start a company and get VC funding to make a better drug. I feel kinda dopey even making this argument because, as a cancer researcher myself, I really think we ought to nationalize the pharma industry, and that profit is a bad motive for drug development for a TON of valid reasons. But it’s just laughable that we’re all out here with the cure to cancer in our back pockets and not doing anything about it because we can’t make money off of it.

GME,"I am a computer science undergrad with some hands-on experience in data-science from a co-op placement. Gathering reliable position data from Reddit posts is likely to be a technically infeasible problem. Scraping ticker symbols, as we've already seen, can be done because it's just counting occurrences; this technique is limited because it can't tell if we really are interested in $CUM or not. Scraping position data would require the scraper to determine:  
1. That a string of characters is actually a position (and while xx@xxx is a commonly used format, it is not the only one).  
2. If this position refers to shares of GME as opposed to literally anything else.  
3. If the position is an actual position the user actually has in GME; finding this would be impossible using only Reddit Data; they would need to backdoor Reddit, find out everybody's personal info, and then trace it to our brokerage accounts.

Even assuming that hedgehogs have the resources to do all that, they would just be exposing themselves to the largest invasion-of-privacy suit imaginable. This would doubtless be seen by what remains of the justice-system as naked market manipulation which would permanently destroy confidence in the reliability of US securities markets.

jobs,"It would be nice to think that the purpose of registration is to keep your profile for future consideration etc.

BUT as someone that knows the value of information, I would not be surprised if they were selling your data to the highest bidder.

Think about it, the employer holds all the cards because (essentially) they have the money aka paychecks, that you (the candidate/job seeker) need. The employer is almost always less desperate than the ocean of applicants, and that desperation forces candidates to surrender their info due to the fear of not getting the job via incomplete information.

That fear is an employer ""claiming"" to not have enough information on you to move forward with the interview process.

But in actuality, what more does an employer need other than your name, ONE form of contact (either phone OR email), city &amp; state and/or zip code, and the details of your resume/CV?

They shouldn't need anymore than that.

But we have applicants giving companies their ENTIRE residential address, BOTH forms of contact, and contacts of references, etc. That's like a wet dream to marketing and advertising companies, free personal data...under the guise of applying for a job.

And the worst part is, for people applying for dozens, hundreds, THOUSANDS of applications, their information could be floating all over cyberspace without their knowledge, AND THEY STILL might end up getting ghosted/rejected anyway, after having surrendered so much data, free of charge.

This is why I'm very careful and select with how I register on an employer's website, what I put on my resume/CV, and why I don't apply for every job under the sun. Although I used to make the same mistakes.

I've gotten a lot of spam/advertisements (both phone and email) from places I've never heard of, and I wondered where they came from since I limited the amount of info I gave anyone EXCEPT for companies I had applied to, then I found my answer.

Yes, in a way it's a double-edged sword/catch-22 scenario, but I'd rather less strangers attempt to make money off of my data unless I at least get an interview in return.",1
IndianDefense,"&gt; The US is on friendly terms with Japan, S Korea and Saudi Arabia and none of those countries are majority white. The US is on unfriendly terms with Russia, a majority white country. 

There are more US troops in Japan than in the state of Hawaii, and more US troops stationed in S Korea than in the US state of Alaska. Saudi Arabia is forced to hold more than $300 billion in US bonds at all times. That sounds very friendly indeed. Whenever Japan develops any new fighter jet it is forced to share all data with the US defense industry thus preventing Japanese aerospace from ever getting ahead. The US still enjoys the spoils of war from WW2 in international influence over the losers.

&gt; There are reasons unrelated to race for which the US aligns with and opposes other countries.

Obviously - at the root of it all though race still decides whether the relationship is long lasting. 

The US [used the Saudis as their personal bank](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2016-05-30/the-untold-story-behind-saudi-arabia-s-41-year-u-s-debt-secret), hitting them up for money and arms sales whenever they needed a little extra cash. 

Now that Saudi oil is less important to the US there are many who want the US to stop its friendship with the Saudis despite the huge US arms purchases they've been forced to make, and their 40+ year 'friendship'. The only reason it's not a public brawl is because the Saudis are using their hundreds of billions in US debt as a weapon to threaten the US with. They threatened to liquidate 70% of their holdings if they were named in the 9/11 reports as terror funders. 

Sounds more like a hostage situation than friendship.

&gt; The US sells 3.4 billion of dollars worth of weapons to India. The US doesn't do this kind of stuff to Russia.

If Russia were to give up its super power ambitions the US would. Even among the Anglo-Saxon countries if any of them threatened the US military or economic supremacy they'd get the sharp end of the stick. The US anyway only sells disabled weapons to everyone - their  missiles are GPS locked so that they cannot be used against any US military base or territory.

Russia under Putin refuses to become a vassal. After the fall of Soviet Russia the US did its best to break up Russia into many pieces. The very idea that Putin is reassembling a small portion of that threatens the US considerably, and thus the very heavy sanctions. Despite this a Russian immigrant to the US is always more welcome than one from India - because, racism.

I expect once Arctic sea routes open up Russia and the US will rapidly arrive at some kind of agreement.

&gt; being anti China in the US has strong bi-partisan support.

Sure, publicly anti-China, privately their business interests come first. Both Trump and Biden have family members doing business with China. China is where a lot of US money is invested, and as long as this is true very little overt action will be taken against them.",0

Unfortunately, they are getting their tools updated by foreign trainers (Russia/China). Many Burmese people need to learn the basics of cybersecurity in order to avoid online harrassment.

Resume,"&gt;As for some of the more specifics, a common theme is I haven't done anything more impressive I can add 😔

This is what everyone thinks. I assure you, it's incorrect. 

Don't focus on the ""Saved school single-handedly"" type things. Instead, try and think of ways you made things better... for yourself, class, other teachers, admin... 

An example I like to use, is if you did something that saved just 5 seconds per activity. Say getting kids in/out of recess. Doesn't sound impressive, right? Three recesses per day, five per week, 40 week school year... that's almost an hour right there. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; the closest I've come to a publication is that data to policy project that got an award and is on the school website and my undergrad research which is also on the school website. No actual publications in an academic journal, just things you'll find by googling my name. 

Not a bad thing to put down, depending on what you are applying for. Remember: a resume is a sales document.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;As for teaching, my most impressive stuff is the leadership things I've been doing this year and I've attempted to put numbers to them. Unfortunately, my school is small so I'm not sure how impressive it is. The numbers actually make it sound less impressive to me but including them makes them perform significantly better in all the free ATS websites you can use so 🤷🏼‍♀️ 

Don't be so hard on yourself. Nobody is expecting ""personally taught 300 kids every day!"". This is one of the reasons why I hate the ""quantify everything"" mantra. It leads to pointless numbering. Focus on the change you brought. Did graduation rates increase while you were there? Standardized test scores? Did you win ""Teacher of the Year""? 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Maybe I really need to stop listening to my intuition at all when it comes to job hunting because hearing people brag about themselves also literally makes me nauseous and I consider it rude lol.

You aren't kidding there. I think most people feel the same (save for the handful that doesn't). But again, this isn't about empty braggadocio, it's about saying that you did cool things before, you will do great things in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Even more unfortunately, my first year teaching I started in the middle of the year as a sub and obviously didn't collect student data because it wouldn't make sense and I haven't collected student data for the past two years because of covid because it wouldn't make sense... (district decisions, not mine) I have no student data 😬

That's fine (and more common than you think). So figure out what you do have. Even if the things aren't specific to you. Did the school ratings go up? Parental approval? What changed from the day you walked in the first time to the last one?",0
changemyview,"""Or getting your test results.""

My facility has rapid testing that takes 30 minutes to generate results.

""Even if you did you could still spread it before getting the result.""
Indeed. I could also be vaccinated, and hypothetically continue to asymptotically spread COVID as well. 

""None of that is worth the risk, but the vaccine is worth the fractional and minuscule risk it poses.""

Using current data, the vaccines seem to have minimal amount of risk. Simultaneously, they for me personally have almost no reward. As is, the small risk doesn't outweigh the even smaller reward.

""Your making the wrong choice."" 

That remains to be seen.",0
coolguides,"There are two huge problems with this table: it assumes password guessers just try character sequences at random (they're actually much smarter than that), and it doesn't take into account how the passwords are hashed on the server (/whatever) (assuming they *are* hashed, that is).

First problem first: when people choose passwords, they don't generally use random sequences of characters; they [usually use words or keyboard patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_most_common_passwords), maybe with some additions/modifications. Password-guessing programs know about this, and try to figure out which passwords are more likely and try those first.

Take ""password"", for example. It's 8 lowercase letters, so according to the table it'd take 1.9 hours to crack; but in fact, it's a word (and a word that's commonly used in passwords for some reason!), so any decent password guesser is going to try it *really* quick. ""Password"", despite the capital letter (which the table says should boost its security to 21 days) isn't much better, because capitalizing the first letter is a common modification. ""Password1"", ""P4$$w0rd"", etc have the same problem; they're common modifications that a guesser will try pretty quick, way before the 14 / 7 years the table says for them.

Realistically, ""abwmlbai"" is a much more secure password than ""P4$$w0rd"", even though the table suggests it's much worse.

Unfortunately, hard-to-guess passwords also tend to be hard to remember. Generally, the best option is to use a password manager to create &amp; store (and back up!) your passwords, and use a [passphrase of random words](https://xkcd.com/936/) as *its* password. (But don't use a meaningful phrase; [the bad guys know about those](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/10/how-the-bible-and-youtube-are-fueling-the-next-frontier-of-password-cracking/)).

Also, submit your email and/or phone # (not your password!) to the [have I been pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com) service, and see if any of your accounts have been involved in a breach (see below), and if they have change their passwords. You can also register to be notified of future breaches you're involved in.

HIBP does have [password checker](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords), which you *can* submit your password to; it uses a [clever method to avoid leaking any ""useful"" info about the submitted password](https://www.troyhunt.com/ive-just-launched-pwned-passwords-version-2/#cloudflareprivacyandkanonymity) to the service (or to anything off your local computer). Some password managers are now integrating this service.

And, for anything you actually care about the security of (which should include your email, since that tends to be used to allow password resets for everything else), you should set up two-factor authentication if the service allows it. (And if possible set up multiple second-factors, so if you lose your phone/whatever, you aren't locked out of everything.)

Second problem: it assumes a fixed attempt rate; in practice, this varies greatly. If the attacker is trying online guessing (i.e. submitting password guesses to some web/mail/whatever server), then it's limited by the server's rate, and that's generally much smaller.

The situation the table is really about is where the bad guys have stolen the server's user+password database (which is depressingly common, see the HIBP database), and are trying to figure out the users' passwords. How quickly they can do this depends massively on how the passwords are stored. The right way to do this is to store a slow (/expensive to compute), salted hash of the password. Different hashes vary greatly in how quickly they can be computed. [This table of hash rates on an 8x GTX 1080 rig](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iwoMR5TBYAZ5eiSphkIQfIEfbrVvWW_tKwS4L1cYlaI/pubhtml?gid=0&amp;single=true) ranges from just 595 attempts/second for the slowest hash up 414 *billion* for the fastest hash. And actually, the good hashes have an adjustable difficulty parameter, so as computers get faster a server admin can just dial the difficulty up to compensate.

Good password hashes also use a ""salt""; a value that's different for each user that gets mixed in with the password. This means that for each possible password a bad guy wants to check, they have to compute the hash separately for each user in the database (rather than computing it once, and then searching the database for matches).

For an example of the worst case, consider the [2014 Yahoo breach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_data_breaches#Late_2014_breach). Most users' passwords were stored as bcrypt hashes (which is a good hash for storing passwords), but some were stored as unsalted MD5 hashes. According to [that table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iwoMR5TBYAZ5eiSphkIQfIEfbrVvWW_tKwS4L1cYlaI/pubhtml?gid=0&amp;single=true), the 8x GTX 1080 rig can try 200 billion guesses per second, and since it's not salted they can check all of those passwords against *all* of the accounts with MD5ed passwords at that rate.

As a user, you have no control at all over how the services you use store your password server-side, and usually you don't even have a way to find out. So you pretty much have to assume the worst case.",1
relationship_advice,"There are thousands of variables involved in human interactions. As far as coincidences I’m not following because you kinda already told us all the big red flags were not true.. like he’s not ghosting you etc. idk I feel like micro analyzing every little thing he does after you have sex sounds like an interpersonal defense mechanism you may have built up due to past experiences. I’m just saying maybe you can do a mental exercise where you check the facts with him and try to focus on those alone. Don’t try to predict his feelings or emotions just analyze the facts. 

1. Is he talking to you (yes)
2. Did he already show you he is sexually attracted to you(yes)
3. Does he want to hang out again(insert here after you ask)
4. Has the nature of your interactions changed(yes) 

In number four is where you’re maybe having issues. Trying to decide how things changed but you don’t have all the data and you’re afraid because of emotions so I would implore that maybe you try to be open minded that your worries may not be fact, they may just be open to interpretation.

tutanota,"The value of all the mail providers not powered by ads (including Tutanota, but also unencrypted providers) is for regular people that they're not the product. I.e. your data is not being collected and sold for advertising purposes, and you become less of a targetable profile.

The encryption aspect offers for the users in the category ""I've got nothing to hide and nobody I know uses Tutanota or PGP"", in my opinion, some safety in case of a large breach. If an unencrypted provider's email storage gets hacked (depending on circumstances, as even non-privacy oriented ones my encrypt data at rest, but they keep the keys themselves), unencrypted emails may be exposed, while encrypted ones won't. Even if they're not important life altering secrets, it's arguably nobody's business what stuff you bought or studied.
