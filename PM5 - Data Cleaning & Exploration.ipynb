      "\n",
      "· An open letter from [September 2020](https://docs4opendebate.be/en/open-letter/) signed by 418 medical doctors states:\n",
      "\n",
      "...Masks belong in contexts where contacts with proven at-risk groups or people with upper respiratory complaints take place, and in a medical context/hospital-retirement home setting. They reduce the risk of droplet infection by sneezing or coughing. Oral masks in healthy individuals are ineffective against the spread of viral infections. Wearing a mask is not without side effects. Oxygen deficiency (headache, nausea, fatigue, loss of concentration) occurs fairly quickly, an effect similar to altitude sickness. Every day we now see patients complaining of headaches, sinus problems, respiratory problems and hyperventilation due to wearing masks. In addition, the accumulated CO2 leads to a toxic acidification of the organism which affects our immunity. Some experts even warn of an increased transmission of the virus in case of inappropriate use of the mask. Our Labour Code (Codex 6) refers to a CO2 content (ventilation in workplaces) of 900 ppm, maximum 1200 ppm in special circumstances. After wearing a mask for one minute, this toxic limit is considerably exceeded to values that are three to four times higher than these maximum values. Anyone who wears a mask is therefore in an extreme poorly ventilated room. Inappropriate use of masks without a comprehensive medical cardio-pulmonary test file is therefore not recommended by recognised safety specialists for workers. Hospitals have a sterile environment in their operating rooms where staff wear masks and there is precise regulation of humidity / temperature with appropriately monitored oxygen flow to compensate for this, thus meeting strict safety standards.\n",
      "\n",
      "· Almost 100% of known transmissions of corona happen from extended interaction (home, work, public transit) - you are very unlikely to get it from a stranger passing you by the sidewalk or by a grocery aisle - see [here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.04.20053058v1) and [here](https://www.nytimes.com./2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html).\n",
      "\n",
      "· Cloth masks are ineffective against transmission of COVID-19 through aerosolized respiratory droplets (i.e. smaller droplets &lt;5 μm that remain in the air for hours) and this airborne route of transmission has just been emphasized by many experts to be the most likely primary means of infection. The solutions that would work to address this route are not cloth masks, which can filter only larger droplets (&gt;5 μm), but \"social distancing, limiting interaction indoors, avoiding air recirculation, improved natural and artificial ventilation, and innovative engineering solutions which collect and neutralise aerosols to provide clean air in personal and community spaces\" ([Wilson et al., 2020](https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3206)). For more details, see also the peer-reviewed [letter to the WHO signed by 239 experts](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798), [this paper](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.03.20167395v1) from August 4, 2020, as well as the corroboration from [(Donaldson, 2020)](https://search.proquest.com/docview/2430860176/fulltext/C115FCBCDAE64E71PQ/1).\n",

      "· This [Finnish governmental report](https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/report_little_or_no_benefit_to_widespread_mask_use/11376476) concluded that the majority of systematic reviews of empirical studies on mask efficacy found no benefit to wearing masks.\n",
      "\n",
      "· Data from US areas with widely different frequencies of mask wearing do not support the idea that cloth masks are effective: e.g. [California](https://justthenews.com/politics-policy/coronavirus/one-month-after-statewide-mask-mandate-california-daily-case-average) *versus* [Arizona](https://www.newsweek.com/arizona-most-anti-mask-state-sees-coronavirus-cases-fall-1519129), as of late July 2020. A [CDC study from mid-October](https://thefederalist.com/2020/10/12/cdc-study-finds-overwhelming-majority-of-people-getting-coronavirus-wore-masks/) 2020 found that \"the overwhelming majority of people getting coronavirus wore masks\". In [November 2020](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.21.20208728v2), a preprint widely shared on social media as putative evidence that mask mandates in the US have been effective was withdrawn by its authors because the new data - i.e. rising infections in areas with mask mandates - do not support their initial conclusions.\n",
      "\n",
      "· Oxford University Professor Carl Heneghan explained on [13 August](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNI2ocgosgA&amp;feature=youtu.be) that UK's recent experience suggests masks for the general public have been ineffective. In a interview from [29 August](https://twitter.com/PhilipWatson_/status/1299850554320072706) he stated: \"the high quality trial evidence for cloth masks suggest they **increase** your rate of reinfection\".\n",

And yeah, he likes to see us triggered, but later with Rizzo he argued his points, and i got the feeling that he is genuinly convinced about that, maybe not hardcore, he said that maybe NRG and Envy could be there, but still, convinced about what i showed on my hated text above. Don´t get me wrong, from an acomplishents and greatness prospective, that list is accurate on the top, BDS has obviously had no rival on that regard. From a gameplay prospective, he is one of the very few people in the world that i´ve heard thinks that, at least the only big rl personality or pro i´ve heard saying it\n",
      "\n",
      "And yeah, many people on reddit already have commented about the speed department being misleading, that NA plays a more controlled style, i knoow. However, i think it´s too naive to think that he is saying this about the speed just to praise ME, in fact he doesn´t say anything in the tweet about ME or EU, he just tells de facts, he did that earlier an a twtich interview with some guys from First Touch. And most of the comments on reddit and twitch were talking about EU vs NA, i think that´s a hint on why he did it, the main objective isn´t to highlight ME, at least that´s not what the majority of people care about or express on the comments. It´s not a coindicence that he is saying all this right now, when the EU vds NA debate is hot and he has a controversial opinion. If he released this when ME was excluded out of RLCS SX, it would have been a diferent story (tbf we didn´t have that much data about ME back then, but still enough). He is just trying to further explain his point with this speed comments, or at least generate debate, he probably knows better than you and i that NA plays a more controlled style\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, i won´t make a big deal about this because it´s not like he is saying woow NA trash, EU miles better, BDS would 3-0 SSG, Monkeymoon would 1v3 NRG, NA defenders are closer to that, you could say much closer even. He just has a controversial opinion that for once i don´t agree with, but that doesn´t mean i don´t find it a bit forced and reactionary to the NA pros\n",

But ultimately, those are not apps in quite the way you're describing. It sounds like what you're maybe describing would be something like tumblr + twitter/IG but for music only. Sort of? Which is an idea I personally would love to see implemented. I also know exactly what you mean with micro-level \"moments\" in songs and wanting to share/highlight those moments. Soundcloud is especially great for that. \n",
      "\n",
      "And I really do feel like I feel where you're coming from in the sense that yeah, music is a huge huge HUGE part of my life yet it's so difficult to share with people, even friends who are really into music. There used to be a website called rabb.it that let you watch shows/movies with friends - I guess they're called something else now and I have no idea if the service is any good. I bring that up because like, can you imagine that but for music? Listening parties with your friends online, taking turns passing around the aux? I'm not a business person or anything but seems like Spotify would be better served if it branched out into creating a social media platform that ran adjacent to the streaming service. Maybe this isn't seen as profitable if it were free with premium, and maybe they have internal data to suggest that not enough people would pay for it as an added feature (I might depending on the price).  \n",
      "\n",
      "I know I'm far from the first to suggest that idea. Music used to be a social experience that has, for better or worse, turned into a largely personal, singular hobby. The idea of listening to music in your home is relatively new, like maybe \\~100 years old (which is not long compared to the history of music). And even then, the idea of listening to music *in your room* or in your car (two of the loneliest places in the world, for me at least) is even newer. Which is not to say music can't or shouldn't be enjoyed in those spaces! I don't mean that at all. I do love concerts and sharing music but sometimes I just... want to listen to stuff alone. But I still want to share it even when I'm alone, I guess, because it means a lot to me. So, yeah, there is a huge need for a social music app. I 100% agree.\n",
